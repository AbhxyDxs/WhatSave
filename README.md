## ‚¨áÔ∏è Download
You can download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/mardous/WhatSave/releases/latest).
Typically, there are two APK files; one for F-Droid and the other for the rest of the stores where
the app is usually available and is the preferred one for downloads not from F-Droid.

There could be a size variation between both files, with the F-Droid file being lighter because it
does not contain Firebase dependencies.
